This is a temporary manual, a more detailed one will be available soon.

It’s recommended to use a brim on the front and rear parts with a chamber at 60°C.

The configuration used for the test prints was: 3 walls, 5 top layers, 5 bottom layers, and 15% infill. However, I also tested some parts with 2 walls, 4 top layers, 4 bottom layers, and 10% infill, and I believe that’s already strong enough.

The heat inserts should be installed aligned with the print orientation.

The panel clips may look identical, but they have a slight difference, they are marked with 1 dot or 2 dots.
